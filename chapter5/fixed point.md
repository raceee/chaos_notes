This theorem follows immediately after the [[intermediate value theorem]]

# Fixed Point Theorem
Supposed $F:[a,b]\rightarrow [a,b]$ is continuous. Then there is a fixed point for $F$ in $[a,b]$

## Remarks
1. This theorem asserts the existence of at least one fixed point for $F$ in $[a,b];$ There may of course be more. For example, all points in any interval $[a,b]$ are fixed by the identity function $F(x) = x$
2. There are several important hypotheses in this teorem, the first two being continuity and the fact that $F$ takes the interval $[a,b]$ into itself. Violation of either of these may yield a function without fixed points.
3. Also, it is important that the interval $[a,b]$ be closed. For example, $F(x) = x^2$ takes the interval $(0, 1/2)$ inside itself and is continuous, but there are no fixed p oints in this open interval (the fixed point 0 lies outside of $(0, 1/2)$)
4. While the Fixed Point Theorem asserts the existence of at least one fixed point, it unfortuanately does not give us any method of acutally finding this point. However, in practice, we often don't need to know exactly where the fixed point lies. Just the knowledge that it is present in a certain interval often suffices for our purposes.
