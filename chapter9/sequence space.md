Considering the dyanamics of the [[quadratic function]] on the set $\Lambda$ we must set up a space that represents what regions the orbit of $\Lambda$ land on. So we define the sequence space.

## Definition
The sequence space on two symbols is the set $$\sum = \{(s_0 s_1 s_2 \dots)|s_j = 0\lor1\}$$This set contains all the possible sequences of 0's and 1's. Because these elements are not numbers we will have to develop some abstract [[metric]] theory.
