## Definition
The *shift map* $\sigma:\sum\rightarrow\sum$ is defined by: $$\sigma (s_0 s_1 s_2 \dots ) = (s_1 s_2 s_3 \dots)$$ That is, $\sigma$ simply drops the first entry of any point in $\sum$.

## Definition
Suppose $F:X\rightarrow X$ is a function and $X$ is a set equipped with a metric $d$. Then $F$ is continuous at $x_0 \in X$ if, for any $\epsilon > 0$, there is a $\delta > 0$ such that, if $d[x, x_0 ] <\delta$ then $d[F(x),F(x_0 )] < \epsilon$. We say that $F$ is a continuous function if $F$ is continuous at all $x_0 \in X$.

## Theorem
The function $\sigma :\sum\rightarrow\sum$ is continuous at all points in $\sum$.

The shift map has [[properties of chaos]] so it is a chaotic dynamical system
