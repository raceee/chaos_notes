## Definition
A dynamical cyctem is *transitive* if for any pair of points $x$ and $y$ and any $\epsilon > 0$ there is a third point $z$ within $\epsilon$ of $x$ whose orbit comes within $\epsilon$ of $y$.

Transitive dynamical system has the property that given any two points, we can find an orbit that comes arbitrarily close to both. Dense orbits are transitive and trasitive dynamical systems have dense orbits.
