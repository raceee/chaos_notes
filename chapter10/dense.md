## Dense Set
Suppose $X$ is a set and $Y$ is a subset of $X$. We say that $Y$ is *dense* in $X$ if, for any point, $x\in X$, there is a point $y$ in the subset $Y$ arbitrarily close to $x$.

## Example
The subset of rational numbers is dense in the set of real numbers.

The subset consisting of all irrational numbers is dense in the set of real numbers
