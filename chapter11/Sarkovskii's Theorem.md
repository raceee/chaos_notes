In order to build Sarkovskii's Theorem we need to have a couple of observations
---
## Observation 1
Suppose $I  = [a,b]$ and $J = [c,d]$ are closed intervals and $I\subset J$. If $F(I)\supset J$, then $F$ has a [[fixed point]] in $I$.

---
## Observation 2
Suppose $I$ and $J$ are two closed intervals and $F(I) \supset J$. Then there is a closed subinterval $I'\subset I$ such that $F(I') = J$.

## Required Lemma's
1. $f$ having even prime period implies period 2
2. If $f$ has a point of prime period $n = 2^a$ then $f$ has a point of prime period $2^b$ for all $a<b$.
3. $f$ has period $2^a$, $f$ has period $2^b$ for $b<a$
4. If $f$ has a point of prime period $p2^m$ then $f$ has a point of period $q2^m$, with $q$ odd and $q>p$
5. If $f$ has a point of prime period $p2^m$, then $f$ has a point of prime period $k2^m$ for any even $k$


## Sarkovskii's Theorem
Suppose $F: \mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is [[continuous]]. Suppose that $F$ has a periodic point of period $n$ and that $n$ precedes $k$ in the Sarkovskii Ordering. Then $F$ also has a periodic point of $k$.

## Sarkovskii's Theorem (Converse)
For all natural numbers $n$, there is a function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ that has a point of prime period $n$, but no point of prime period $m$ with $m\prec n$
