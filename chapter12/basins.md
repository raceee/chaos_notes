##### Definition
Suppose $x_0$ is an attracting fixed point of $F$. The basin of attraction of $x_0$ is the set of all points whose orbits tend to $x_0$. The immediate basin of attraction of $x_0$ is the largest interval containing $x_0$ that lies in the basin of attraction

---

The Attracting Fixed Point Theorem in [[attracting_repelling]] guarantees that attracting fixed points and cycles have immediate basins of attraction

*usually* the immediate basin of attraction of an attracting fixed point is smaller than the full basin.

##### Theorem
Suppose the [[schwarzian derivative]] $<0$. If $x_0$ is an attracting periodic point for $F$, then either the immediate basin of attraction of $x_0$ extends to $+\infty$ or $-\infty$, or else there is a critical point of $F$ whose orbit is attracting to the orbit of $x_0$.
