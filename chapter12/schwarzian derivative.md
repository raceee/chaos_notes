##### Definition

Fucntions with negative Schwarzian derivatives have very interesting dynamical properties that simplify their analysis.

The Schwarzian derivative of a funciton $F$ is $$SF(x) = \frac{F'''(x)}{F'(x)} - \frac{3}{2}\left( \frac{F''(x)}{F'(x)}\right)^2$$

##### Propostiion 
Suppose $P(x)$ is polynomial and all roots of $P
'(x)$ are real and distinct. Then $SP < 0$.

##### Chain Rule for Schwarzian Derivatives
Suppose  $F$ and $G$ are functions. Then $$S(F\circ G)(x) = SF(G(x))(G'(x))^2 + SG(x)$$

	Corollary
	Suppose $SF < 0$ and $SG < 0$. Then $S(F\circ G) < 0$. In particular, if $SF < 0$, then $SF^m < 0$.

##### Schwarzian Min-Max Principle
Suppose $SF < 0$. Then $F'$ cannot have a positive local minimum or a negative local maximum.
